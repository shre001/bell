## Day1 Learning
Some of the learning for today were:

1. Analyzed the given Excel sheet and figured out the only way to get lat and long was from the address given.
2.Discovered the libraries available in python and learnt about geocode and reverse geocode.
3. Came across geopy library that has several geocoders. Chose Nominatim module to suit my needs for this problem statement.
4. Found inconsistency in the given address as geocode took data in specific format. Ex: Postal B3j2k9 was not accepting. Instead B3j 2k9 was a good parameter. Hence data cleaning was necessary.
5.Found a way to add status bar using progressbar and tqdm modules.
6. extracted mapInfo file geoJson 
7. extracted coordinates in the Json file  using json reader.
